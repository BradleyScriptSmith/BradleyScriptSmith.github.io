      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m an IT Systems Specialist in higher education. I focus on reliable IT operations, systems administration,
        endpoint management, troubleshooting, and automation. I enjoy building clean, repeatable processes
        that reduce downtime and improve user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m working toward expanding into a full systems administrator role, with a strong interest in security,
        infrastructure, and continuous improvement.
